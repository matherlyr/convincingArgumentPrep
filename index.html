                  <li>Movies allow students who are visual learners to create a better mental picture of concepts. For example, to understand 
                        the role that the Enigma played in the conflict between the British and the Nazis, a teacher could show the movie 
                        Imitation Game to a class.</li>
                  <li>Movies can take learning beyond the textbook by applying concepts to real-life events. For example, watching a movie
                        like McFarland, USA gives students a real-life event that displays the struggles of life in America as an immigrant.</li>
